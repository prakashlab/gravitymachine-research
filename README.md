# Squid-tracking

Squid (Simplifying Quantitive Imaging Development and Deployment) [1] provides a full suite of hardware and software components for rapidly configuring high-performance microscopes tailored to users' applications with reduced cost, effort and turnaround time. Besides increasing accessibility of research microscopes and available microscope hours to labs, it is also designed to simplify development and dissemination of new or otherwise advanced microscopy techniques. For more information, visit our website: https://www.squid-imaging.org

This repo hosts the current tracking software, which was first developed for scale-free vertical tracking microscopy (a.k.a Gravity Machine) [2], refactored with the new squid code base, and now applied back to squid for it to support tracking microscopy.
